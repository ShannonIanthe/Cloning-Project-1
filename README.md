# Cloning-Project-1
Created a Clone of a Website 

This project was really fun because I got to be creative. <br>
This my first project at my coding bootcamp. <br>
We were to clone a website and add specific features however adding our own photos and business idea. <br>
I chose to create a Coffee Business named Hola Dia. <br>
I was creative with the colors however I am not fully satisfied with the outcome. I plan to take a UX / UI design course so that I can create more eye catching organized websites. <br>
